          <p>I created this simple, yet specifically targeted app to be able to manage students.</p>
          <p>Using JSX for the front end and MongoDB for the database, students can be added and removed from the roster, notes can be created, updated, and removed.</p> 
          <p>Lastly, you can update or remove the lesson book that theyâ€™re currently working in.</p>

          <p>DeveloperWeek Hackathon team project designed to browse and search multiple video services at the same time.</p> 
          <p>I worked on the Amazon Prime portion and back end API to pull the data. The Amazon Prime portion was working, however it was cut for time.</p>
          <p>Currently, the project uses OMDB as a test search API. I also removed a few bugs that would crash the app on android.</p>

          <p>A richer version of my student tracking app, using server-side rendering.</p>
          <p>Using NextJs, it will include a roster, admin editing capabilities, teacher and student roles, and more thorough note and lesson tracking.</p>
          <p>It currently has adding and deleting capabilities.</p>
