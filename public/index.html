        <p>Hello! I'm Curtis. Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in art and I use that background to craft solid websites with a pleasant user experience. With a passion and hunger for improvement, I'm continuously learning new technologies and solidifying what I know through exploration, research, and ongoing projects. I use my skills to enable people to present themselves and their brand at their best to the world through the web. </p>
